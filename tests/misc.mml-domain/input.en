Food: Where European inflation slipped up 
The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation. 
November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with October's 2.6 percent yr/yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November, the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported. 
Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent, Bloomberg said. 
As opposed to the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut interest rates, arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral. 
The ECB wants to hold inflation to under two percent, or somewhere in that vicinity.
