i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday 3 february 2000 .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the sitting on thursday 3 february have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
i can see from your reaction that many of the members of parliament have not received the minutes and clearly you cannot approve minutes which you have not seen .
i therefore propose to submit the minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and i must apologise for this .
i shall therefore postpone the approval of the minutes .
