My talk is " Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes . "
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you 'll see a little bit of a relation .
It ties to origami . So let me start .
What is origami ?
Most people think they know what origami is . It 's this : flapping birds , toys , cootie catchers , that sort of thing .
And that is what origami used to be .
But it 's become something else .
It 's become an art form , a form of sculpture .
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form .
You know , it 's very old . This is a plate from 1797 .
